A BibTeX system in Common Lisp
******************************

This project provides a replacement for the BibTeX program, written in
Common Lisp. The aim is to enable the user to format bibliographic
entries using Common Lisp programs, rather than using the stack
language of BibTeX style files.

The project pages are at 

    http://www.freesoftware.fsf.org/cl-bibtex/

Where to start
==============

Compile and load all Lisp files, using bibtex.system.

The function BIBTEX is like the bibtex program.  Pass the file name
STEM; BIBTEX will read STEM.aux, interpret a BST file, and write
STEM.bbl:

	(bibtex "ibm-theory")

The package BIBTEX-RUNTIME contains useful routines for reading AUX
files, formatting names, etc.

You can invoke a preliminary BST-to-Common-Lisp compiler with the
function COMPILE-BST-FILE:

	 (compile-bst-file (kpathsea:find-file "amsalpha.bst")
		  "/tmp/compiled-bst.lisp")

The resulting Lisp file is a readable Common Lisp version of the BST
file, which can be run on the AUX file to produce a BBL file, without
using the BST interpreter:

        (load "/tmp/compiled-bst.lisp" :if-source-newer :compile)
	(cl-bibtex "ibm-theory" 'amsalpha)


Restrictions of the compiler
============================

The BST->CL compiler works by analyzing the type of the wizard-defined
functions (i.e., those defined by a FUNCTION command in the BST
file).  The compiler tries to find out how many "literals" (values) a
function pops from the stack and how many it pushes and determines
their types (BOOLEAN, INTEGER, STRING).

* If a wizard-defined function tries to pop a function literal that it
  hasn't pushed, or leaves a function literal on the stack, you lose.
  (In other words, you can't define higher-order BST functions.)

* The two branches of an IF$ function must deliver the same net number
  of values.

* The body of a WHILE$ function must be neutral on the stack (as a
  special exception, the type of WHILE$ body occurring in the
  FORMAT.NAMES function of the standard styles is also supported.  The
  predicate must deliver exactly one boolean value.


Implementation dependencies
===========================

It does not run on SBCL because it does not like (COPY-READTABLE NIL).

I noticed that CMUCL 3.0.8 18c+ does not like (PEEK-CHAR T STREAM NIL
#\Space); it won't skip over whitespace when the EOF character is
whitespace?
