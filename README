Where to start
==============

Compile and load all Lisp files.

The function BIBTEX is like the bibtex program.  Pass the file name
STEM; BIBTEX will read STEM.aux, interpret a BST file, and write
STEM.bbl.

The package BIBTEX-RUNTIME contains useful routines for reading AUX
files, formatting names, etc.

You can invoke a preliminary BST-to-Common-Lisp compiler with the
function COMPILE-BST-FILE:

	 (compile-bst-file (kpathsea:find-file "amsalpha.bst")
		  "/tmp/compiled-bst.lisp")

The resulting Lisp file is meant to be a readable Common Lisp version
of the BST file, which can be run on the AUX file to produce a BBL
file, without using the BST interpreter.

The generated code currently does not run, though.
