An -*- outline -*- of the new features in CL-BibTeX

* News in version 0.2

** Nested .aux files are now handled.

** The crossref feature has been implemented.

** A model for Lisp BibTeX styles has been implemented.

   A Lisp BibTeX style is a Lisp program in a file with type "lbst".  
   The Lisp program is supposed to define a BibTeX style using the
   macro DEFINE-BIBTEX-STYLE or the function REGISTER-BIBTEX-STYLE.

   The BIBTEX function first looks for already registered styles, then
   it tries to find and load "lbst" files, then it tries to find and
   interpret "bst" files.

   The BST->CL compiler now puts all the code of a BibTeX style into a
   separate package and emits a DEFINE-BIBTEX-STYLE form.

** Portability improvements.

   CL-BibTeX now works with CMUCL, SBCL 0.7.9, and CLISP 2.30.
